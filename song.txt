Ey, this is special what is happenin' to all my
All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, and start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to em baby girl

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life

Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life
